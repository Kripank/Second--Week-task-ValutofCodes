# Second--Week-task-ValutofCodes
During the second week of my internship, I successfully completed the initial phase of my mini-project, which focused on developing a basic to-do list application.
In this mini-project to develop a basic to-do list, the application empowers users with three fundamental functions: adding tasks, removing tasks, and viewing tasks.

Adding Tasks: Users can easily input new tasks into the to-do list. Whether it's a work assignment, a personal errand, or any other task, the user can quickly create a new entry to keep track of what needs to be done.

Removing Tasks: When a task is completed or no longer relevant.

Viewing Tasks: The heart of any to-do list is the ability to view tasks. The application presents all the tasks in an organized manner.
